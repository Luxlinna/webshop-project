# Webshop Project

This project is a webshop application split into two main parts:

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot application
- **Frontend:** Vite.js application

---

## Project Structure

```

webshop-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webshop/             # Backend (Java Spring Boot)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webshop-frontend/    # Frontend (Vite.js)

````

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Java, Maven, Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** Vite.js, JavaScript/TypeScript (depending on your setup)
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11+ (or the version your Spring Boot project requires)
- Maven
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- VSCode (recommended)

---

### Running the Backend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd webshop-project/webshop
````

2. Run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend service will start, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

---

### Running the Frontend

1. Open a separate terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd webshop-project/webshop-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend app will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite selects).

---

## Development Notes

* This project is developed using Visual Studio Code.
* You can open the root folder `webshop-project` in VSCode to manage both backend and frontend simultaneously.
* Use VSCode terminals or separate terminal windows/tabs for running backend and frontend concurrently.
